## 📖 Abstract
Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly evolving into cultural producers, yet they are not culturally neutral. Existing alignment research has focused on lexical toxicity or demographic biases, often overlooking a deeper Narrative Structural Bias (NSB): a systematic preference for plot structures, conflict resolutions, and character motivations that align with the LLM's latent normative priors. We propose a novel framework to measure NSB. We introduce a benchmark CuNA with five sociocognitive categories, and a Structural-Value Pipeline that combines Labov \& Waletzky narrative deconstruction with Hofstede’s cultural dimensions. We evaluate six diverse state-of-the-art LLMs (e.g., Gemini, GPT, Qwen) using a cross-lingual design. Results reveal that individual LLMs exhibit distinct, entrenched structural preferences, exposing systematic NSB inherent to specific architectures and prompt language acts as a "cultural primer" that shifts this narrative logic, providing support for computational Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis. This work provides the first comprehensive framework for auditing NSB, offering insights for mitigating algorithmic narrative cultural hegemony.
